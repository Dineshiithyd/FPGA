Step follow here(Report:  https://github.com/Dineshiithyd/FPGA/blob/master/OscilloReport.pdf  )
1. First we need to convert mp3/mp4 file into wav file through python code 
2. Converted wav file we need to read data. So we install wavesurfer software and read data from wav file and save as .txt file.
3. Now we recevied data run into the python code. 
4.We have implemented low pass, band pass filter and high pass filter. we are getting   data of low ,high pass & band pass filter 
through online . 
5. Now recevied data (txt file) we convert them into wav file using python code.
6.In last,We will see both file the extarcted one came form filter & Original .
SOME IMPROVEMENTS:
We playback the	Original	and	Filtered	data	by	using	pyAudio	library	of	python	and	analysed	how	the	generated	sound	will	change	when	we	apply appropriate	filter	to	it.
